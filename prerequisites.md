# Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription
- A paid Fabric capacity or trial
- Graph enabled at tenant level, for the whole organisation or security group as required

- Permissions to create workspaces and items such as Lakehouse, Notebook and Graph Model.


> [!CAUTION]
> Graph is available on F2 or above but the initial load is computationally intenstive so consider F8 at least.


> [!TIP]
> The Setup activity will create a new workspace (`Graph Tutorial`) and new Lakehouse in that workspace called `lh_graph`.

If you do not have any of the prerequisites, work with your instructor to set them up.

## Introduction

> Graph in Microsoft Fabric is a scalable, enterprise-grade solution that turns disconnected data into AI-powered insights.  
Unlike traditional relational databases that often require costly joins and complex queries, graph in Microsoft Fabric:  
>- Introduces a scale-out architecture that implements the flexible labeled property graph model.
>- Offers data querying functionality that's compliant with the international standard for the graph query language GQL (ISO/IEC 39075).

>Together, these capabilities enable advanced graph analytics directly on OneLake without the need to manually set up brittle ETL (extract, transform, load) or data replication workflows.[1]
